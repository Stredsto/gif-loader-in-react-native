How to have a gif loader in react native app.

React native does not have a default thing for loading GIFs into your apps so what you can so is use facebook's fresco library to have this working and then you directly load your GIF in image tag.

Fresco library Added in /{prject_name}/android/app/build.gradle on line 187 and 188.
